# Welcome to Learn to Homelab

## Why did we start to Learn to Homelab, and why you should use us?
We are unsure how you made it here, but we are happy! So, who are we you may ask? We are passionate individuals who believe that information training content (IT) should be COMPLETE and obvious! What do we mean by that? We mean that no question should be left unanswered; think about the number of times you have followed a course and instantly became lost; this could be for numerous reasons, a lack of explanation by the presenter, assumed knowledge, or a lack of detail. Our goal is to solve that. Our walkthroughs will be LONG, but they will be the easiest and most informational walkthroughs for the most BEGINNER individuals ever.

## How to use our site:
At the top of your browser, you will see a navigation bar; the tabs are separated by courses that you can follow along with on our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@LearntoHomelab). On the left side of your screen, we have pages for each video in the series; on the right side, we have the table of contents for the current video/topic you are reading about.
