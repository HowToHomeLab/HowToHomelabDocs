# Note taking, Obsidian Note Taking Install 

Obsidian is a note-taking and knowledge management software designed to help users organize, connect, and develop their ideas. It is based on the concept of a "personal knowledge base" (PKB) and utilizes a method known as "markdown" for formatting text.

As our video explained, Note taking is a critical tool and a skill you must master, no one likes paperwork but proper documentation easily makes up almost half of IT roles. 

The last step in the troubleshooting methodology is document the solution. It is described as, "Document the troubleshooting process, including the problem description, steps taken, root cause, and solution implemented. This documentation can serve as a reference for future troubleshooting efforts and knowledge sharing." You will become a master of the troubleshooting methodology as time goes on, one thing to keep in mind, the symptoms do not always characterize the root cause of your issue.

After that there is a couple things we need to do. 

1. We first need to create a folder (top left) that will store our images. 

2. Then we will go to the settings on the bottom left (gear icon) change or theme to dark mode under *appearance*

3. Then select the folder for our images that we just created under *files and links*. 

4. Lastly, you can create a new note (exit the settings and on the top left it is the ben and square icon by the folder icon) and give it a try.
