# Note taking, Obsidian Note Taking and Install 

Obsidian is a notetaking and knowledge management software designed to help users organize, connect, and develop their ideas. It is based on the concept of a "personal knowledge base" (PKB) and utilizes a method known as "markdown" for formatting text.

As our video explained, Note-taking is a critical tool and a skill you must master. No one likes paperwork, but proper documentation easily makes up almost half of IT roles, **not to mention there will be A LOT of times you forget something and wish youâ€™d made a note. **

The last step in the troubleshooting methodology is to document the solution. It is described as "Document the troubleshooting process, including the problem description, steps taken, root cause, and solution implemented. This documentation can be a reference for future troubleshooting efforts and knowledge sharing." You will become a master of the troubleshooting methodology as time goes on; one thing to keep in mind is that the symptoms do not always characterize the root cause of your issue.

After that, there are a couple of things we need to do. 

1. First, we must create a folder (top left) to store our images. 

2. Then we will go to the settings on the bottom left (gear icon) and change the theme to dark mode under *appearance*

3. Select the folder for the images we created under *files and links*. 

4. Lastly, you can create a new note (exit the settings; on the top left is the pen and square icon by the folder icon).

If you are unfamiliar with the Markdown format, please refer to their documentation [here](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax)
